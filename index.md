I am a **marine quantitative ecologist** at **IMARPE (Peru)** working at the interface of **fisheries science**, **stock assessment**, and **spatio-temporal modeling**. My work focuses on translating **complex, dynamic marine systems** into **quantitative evidence** that supports monitoring, assessment, and decision-making in fisheries and marine resource management.

I integrate **population and community ecology** with **modern statistical modeling** to understand how marine populations respond to **environmental variability** and **human pressures**, and to design analytical frameworks and management strategies that remain **robust under change**.

## Core areas of work
- **Stock assessment and population dynamics**, including uncertainty-aware modeling of recruitment, growth, mortality, and abundance.
- **Spatio-temporal ecology**, quantifying distribution, habitat use, and shifts in availability across heterogeneous seascapes.
- **Indicators and monitoring systems**, linking biological condition, spatial structure, and productivity to management-relevant metrics.
- **Open-source scientific tools** and **reproducible workflows** in **R, Python, and Julia**.

## How I work
I develop **transparent, reproducible, and scalable analytical pipelines** that bridge research and operational decision-making. My approach emphasizes interpretability, diagnostics, and explicit treatment of uncertainty, ensuring that results can be updated, audited, and communicated effectively.

Through **Blue Ecological Systems** and **Pelagytics**, I translate scientific methods into **practical tools and services**, including:
- indicator-based monitoring frameworks,
- spatio-temporal and habitat models,
- and decision-support products tailored to real fisheries systems.

### Overview
This abstract quantifies **interannual to multi-decadal** components of biomass variability (1953–2022) for the **north-central anchoveta stock**, supporting clearer separation of **structural change** versus **short-term fluctuations** in the Humboldt Current System.

### Key points
- **Multi-scale decomposition** of biomass variability (1953–2022) for the north-central anchoveta stock.
- Improved interpretation by separating **structural change** from **short-term fluctuations**.
- Practical implications for **monitoring** and **management robustness** in EBUS.
